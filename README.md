Hi! This is Priyanshu. 

This is my GitHub repository for AuE8230: Autonomy Science and Systems. 

1. All packages were developed on Ubuntu 20.04 using ROS Noetic
2. The file structure of this repository is similar to a ROS-Noetic file system
3. Each package contains its own README.md file

Here is a copy of the final presentation:
